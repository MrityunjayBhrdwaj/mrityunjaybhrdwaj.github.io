## Um, what am i looking at?

This is a simple Gaussian Process regression visualization, which tries to fit the best possible curve from the given data points.

Just tap on the grid(Data Space) to add a new data points ( you can also drag the data points by click and drag), play with the controls on the right and hit Recalculate!

## But, What is a Gaussian Process?

### From Wiki:

In probability theory and statistics, a Gaussian process is a stochastic process (a collection of random variables indexed by time or space), such that every finite collection of those random variables has a multivariate normal distribution, i.e. every finite linear combination of them is normally distributed. The distribution of a Gaussian process is the joint distribution of all those (infinitely many) random variables, and as such, it is a distribution over functions with a continuous domain, e.g. time or space.
