## Um, what am i looking at?

This is a simple linear regression which tries to fit the best possible line from the given data points.

Just tap on the grid(Data Space) to add a new data points ( you can also drag the data points by click and drag),  play with the controls on the right and hit recalculate!

## Hyperparameters:

Epoch: for how long should we run the gradient descent iteraction.

Learning rate: how much we scale our gradient at each time step to correct our model.

## But, What is Linear Regression?

The goal of this method is to determine the linear model that minimizes the sum of the squared errors between the observations in a dataset and those predicted by the model. 

<!-- TODO: add viz of sequared error -->
<!-- we can visualize these sequared errors by simply clicking on 'view squared error button' as well as see our SSE decreasing overtime in the top right loss plot. -->

<!-- TODO: write colab notebook on implementing LR from scratch. -->
<!-- If you are someone who learns by doing, then please checkout our tutorial on how to implement Linear Regression from scratch! -->
